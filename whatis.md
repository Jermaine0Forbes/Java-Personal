### number data types

Type | Size | Range
--- | --- | ---
byte | 8 bits | -128 to 127
short | 16 bits | -32,768 to 32,767
int | 32 bits | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long | 64 bits | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float | 32 bits | 3.40282347 x 10<sup>38</sup> to 1.40239846 x 10<sup>-45</sup>
double | 64 bits | 1.7976931348623157 x 10 <sup>308</sup>  to  4.9406564584124654 x 10<sup>-324</sup>



### what is an abstract class

an abstract class is a class that can not be instantiated, but the purpose is
to create a base structure of a class so that subclasses can inherit its properties

### what is multithreading

**My definition:** I think it has to do with different processes or programs running
at the same and not waiting on one another to finish. I think with single threading
you have to wait for one process to finish and the another process to load. But with
multithreading you can you run multiple processes at the same time. At least this is
I what I getting from articles and videos.
