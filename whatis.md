### what is multithreading

**My definition:** I think it has to do with different processes or programs running
at the same and not waiting on one another to finish. I think with single threading
you have to wait for one process to finish and the another process to load. But with
multithreading you can you run multiple processes at the same time. At least this is
I what I getting from articles and videos.
