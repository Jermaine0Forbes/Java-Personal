### what are interfaces

- [jenkof](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/interfaces.html):Java includes a concept called interfaces. A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method.
- [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/interface-in-java): The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
- My definition: They are similar to abstract classes except you can
	- **implement** multiple interfaces in one base class
	-  methods will be set **public abstract** by default. Whereas properties will be set as
	**public static final** by the default
	- and I think that is it
